      <p>Titan is an investment company that aims to make wealth-building accessible to everyone. Since it was founded in 2018, the company has  been on a mission to provide access to investment opportunities that were once only available to the super-rich.


        <p>In 2022, we introduced Alternatives (think Venture Capital, Private Credit, and Real Estate) directly supporting this mission. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best timing. The stock market had a tough year, and people were more focused on protecting their money than seeking higher returns. Then, in March 2023, the collapse of SVB bank made investors even more wary of big banks and long for safe ways to invest…</p> 
        
        Despite the setback, Titan chose to lean in, listen to its users and change strategy.

      <p>If my team was to improve the electronic signature flow, we needed to understand the regulations around PI oversight: Why are signatures necessary? To what extent can we change the status quo?</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="twoCol-center">
    <div>
      <h4>Regulation vs Guidelines</h4>
      <p>There is a lot of ambiguity around the interpretation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). When it comes to physician oversight, the FDA establishes general guidelines that can be translated broadly and (too often) inconsistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        This became apparent to me when interviewing CRCs who had varied experiences working with auditors and data monitors at the site level. I quickly discovered that varying degrees of leniency ultimately affect how coordinators approach physician oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, some CRCs held very conservative views on PI oversight (e.g. it’s necessary that my PI looks over and signs off on all forms in a timely manner to ensure accuracy and proper oversight, especially if an auditor were to investigate), while others seemed more lax (e.g. unless there’s an urgent matter, I don’t think it’s necessary for my PI to sign off on every form).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a company, we constantly have to weigh the potential benefits and risks of efficiency over thoroughness.

      <div class="quote3">
          <p>I don’t trust that my PI can navigate through Source without accidentally modifying data. I feel better helping him in-person so that I can answer any questions. My PI is smart, obviously, but not the most tech-savvy. - CRC</p>

          <h2 id="ideate">Ideate & Review</h2>
          <p>Next, I began sketching and wireframing, looping in my PM and engineers early on and continuously throughout the process.</p>
          <p>Some ideas that we pursued early on were around consolidating signoff. For example, having one signature apply to all forms for a visit rather than requiring PIs to sign off on multiple forms. We then discussed conditional signatures, such that a PI would only have to sign a form if it included “high-risk” data. We had several meetings with key stakeholders discussing the appropriate level of physician oversight.
          </p>

  <div class="twoCol-left">
    <div>
    <p>While it would have been ideal to create a visit-level/ ‘sign all’ capability to expedite signoff, we weren’t able to get buy-in from clinical team members who felt strongly that PIs need to review each form individually. Here, the ongoing battle between efficiency and thoroughness swayed towards thoroughness. 
    </p>
    <p>Though we weren’t aligned (just yet) on a ‘sign all’ feature, I set out to solve the known pain points with the existing flow:

            <p>After signing a form, PI does not receive any visual indicators that the signature was successfully executed and is automatically brought to the next form on the list (which doesn’t necessarily require a signature). PI then has to navigate to the side panel to find the next form that requires action.

     <p>I used weekly product/design syncs to validate solutions and refine accordingly. Mainly, these meetings helped ensure that what I was proposing was in-scope. I looped in CRCs during the later phase of my design work, often to uncover usability issues and opportunities for improvement.</p>

       <h2>Learnings & Reflection</h2>
          <p class="definition">After each design sprint, my team liked to debrief with an exercise called “I like, I wish, I wonder…” to gather open and honest feedback. Here are my takeaways:</p>
       
       <div class="twoCol-left">
           <div>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I like</span> that design and engineering collaborated closely and efficiently so that we could incorporate the new UI system into the feature rollout. I also like that we were able to involve Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) in the design process, ensuring that we were addressing their pain points head on.</p>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I wish</span> that we could have challenged the status quo by making more meaningful changes to the signature flow (e.g. batch signoff, sign via mobile instead of desktop, eliminating signatures altogether). However, this would have required much more time and cross-functional effort to align with clinical study team stakeholders and could have risked negatively impacting our relationship with conservative pharmaceutical companies (trial sponsors).</p>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I wonder</span> how long it would have taken us to prioritize these changes if COVID-19 had not impacted our ability to conduct in-person studies. Though CRC & PI user pain points had existed for a long time, there wasn’t a strong enough business reason to divert engineering resources towards addressing them. However, given how quickly the world around us can change the needs of a business and its users, it is even more important to be able to adapt quickly.</p>

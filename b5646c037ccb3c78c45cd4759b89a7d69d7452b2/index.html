 <div class="twoCol-left handy-intro">
    <div>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">TrialSpark brings clinical trials to the local doctor’s office.</span> Traditionally, clinical research is conducted in large academic hospitals and universities. This means that patients who don’t live in cities near these institutions often never learn about or have access to clinical trials that directly target their disease. TrialSpark diversifies access by assembling a team of roaming researchers who travel directly to doctors’ local practices to set up trial sites.</p>
      <p>This new model has its challenges:</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Aligning CRC and PI schedules.</span> At TrialSpark, research coordinators are not permanently stationed at one site (often travelling to multiple in a week), which makes aligning schedules with PIs especially difficult. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Working with <a href="https://www.qservegroup.com/eu/en/i420/the-research-naive-study-site--always-a-problem" style="font-weight: bold" target="_"> research naive</a> sites.</span> Doctors who participate in TrialSpark studies do not have dedicated daily research personnel (nurses, resident students, disease specialists etc.) to carry out the enormous workload involved in conducting studies. This puts the unfair burden on CRCs to carry out administrative and communication responsibilities normally delegated to PIs and other research staff.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Getting PIs to use TrialSpark technology independently.</span> TrialSpark PIs are not accustomed to using clinical research software, further relying on the help of research coordinators.</p>

 <h4 class="caption">Some more context</h3>
   <div class="definition">
          <p>When I started at TrialSpark, physicians were not accustomed to using Pilot software independently to sign off on forms. Instead, they relied on research coordinators to help them sign in and navigate to the appropriate forms that required action. Pilot, at the time, was simply <span style="font-weight: bold">not built to support physicians’ workflows</span>. For example, there were no visual indicators from the homepage directing physicians to the specific forms that required their review. Moreover, the system lacked simple microinteractions, like tooltips and progress indicators, to make it easier for users to understand where to go and anticipate what will happen next.</p>
    </div>
   <!-- context -->
      <div class="definition">
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Obviously this was inefficient.</span> Coordinators had to repeatedly wait long hours (5+) after a patient visit to meet with physicians to get signatures. This was especially inconvenient because TrialSpark coordinators were not permanently stationed at these sites. Though securing signatures at the end of a patient visit was the ideal scenario, this was rarely feasible.</p> 
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Then COVID-19 happened</span>, which sparked a team-wide initiative to support and streamline remote signoff.</p>

    <h2>Problem Framing</h2>
    <p>PIs are unable to electronically sign off on study forms independently. This is problematic because:</p>
    <p>1. CRCs are blocked without these signatures, causing them to wait unnecessarily long hours after a patient visit to physically meet with PIs to get signoff.</p>
    <p>2. Remote patient visits are becoming more common, which means PIs and CRCs need to be able to execute all study tasks autonomously.</p>

      <p>If my team was to improve the electronic signature flow, we needed to understand the regulations around PI oversight: Why are signatures necessary? To what extent can we change the status quo?</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="twoCol-center">
    <div>
      <h4>Regulation vs Guidelines</h4>
      <p>There is a lot of ambiguity around the interpretation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). When it comes to physician oversight, the FDA establishes general guidelines that can be translated broadly and (too often) inconsistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        This became apparent to me when interviewing CRCs who had varied experiences working with auditors and data monitors at the site level. I quickly discovered that varying degrees of leniency ultimately affect how coordinators approach physician oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, some CRCs held very conservative views on PI oversight (e.g. it’s necessary that my PI looks over and signs off on all forms in a timely manner to ensure accuracy and proper oversight, especially if an auditor were to investigate), while others seemed more lax (e.g. unless there’s an urgent matter, I don’t think it’s necessary for my PI to sign off on every form).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a company, we constantly have to weigh the potential benefits and risks of efficiency over thoroughness.

            <div class="quote2">
                <p>I literally have to quadruple check [Pilot] to ensure all forms have been signed off. This can mean clicking into 20 forms sometimes... There’s no way around it. - CRC</p>

            <div class="quote3">
                <p>I don’t trust that my PI can navigate through Source without accidentally modifying data. I feel better helping him in-person so that I can answer any questions. My PI is smart, obviously, but not the most tech-savvy. - CRC</p>

          <p>Next, I began sketching and wireframing, looping in my PM and engineers early on and continuously throughout the process.</p>
          <p>Some ideas that we pursued early on were around consolidating signoff. For example, having one signature apply to all visit forms rather than requiring PIs to sign off on multiple forms. We then discussed conditional signatures, such that a PI would only have to sign a form with “high-risk” data. We had several meetings with key stakeholders discussing the appropriate level of physician oversight.

    <p>While it would have been ideal to create a visit-level/ ‘sign all’ capability to expedite signoff, we weren’t able to get buy-in from clinical team members who felt strongly that PIs need to review each form individually. Here, the ongoing battle between efficiency and thoroughness swayed towards thoroughness. 
    </p>
    <p>Though we weren’t aligned (just yet) on a ‘sign all’ feature, I set out to solve the known pain points with the existing flow:

        <p>Even though my focus was on the experience of CRCs and PIs, I needed to understand the impact of feature changes on all 4 user types, including auditors (CRAs) and clinical data managers (CDMs). Given that each user type has distinct permissions and views, it was important to specify whether or not each user would see/interact with the new changes.</p>

     <p>I used weekly product/design syncs to validate solutions and refine accordingly. Mainly, these meetings helped ensure that what I was proposing was in-scope. I looped in CRCs during the later phase of my design work, often to uncover usability issues and opportunities for improvement.</p>

     <p>I went through a series of iterations to figure out the most effective visual treatment that would easily guide the user to each form that requires action. </p>
     <P>The status labels needed to clearly show which forms require signatures and further differentiate those that are <span style="font-weight: bold">ready</span> to be signed (e.g. data is complete) from those that are <span style="font-weight: bold">not ready</span> (e.g. data is partially entered).</P>

       <h2>Learnings & Reflection</h2>
          <p class="definition">After each design sprint, my team liked to debrief with an exercise called “I like, I wish, I wonder…” to gather open and honest feedback. Here are my takeaways:</p>
       
       <div class="twoCol-left">
           <div>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I like</span> that design and engineering collaborated closely and efficiently so that we could incorporate the new UI system into the feature rollout. I also like that we were able to involve Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) in the design process, ensuring that we were addressing their pain points head on.</p>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I wish</span> that we could have challenged the status quo by making more meaningful changes to the signature flow (e.g. batch signoff, sign via mobile instead of desktop, eliminating signatures altogether). However, this would have required much more time and cross-functional effort to align with clinical study team stakeholders and could have risked negatively impacting our relationship with conservative pharmaceutical companies (trial sponsors).</p>
             <p><span style="font-weight: bold">I wonder</span> how long it would have taken us to prioritize these changes if COVID-19 had not impacted our ability to conduct in-person studies. Though CRC and PI user pain points had existed for a long time, there wasn’t a strong enough business reason to divert engineering resources towards addressing them. However, given how quickly the world around us can change the needs of a business and its users, it is even more important to be able to adapt quickly.</p>
